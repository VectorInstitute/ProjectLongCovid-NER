# Towards Providing Clinical Insights on Long Covid from Twitter Data 

From the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic social media has
provided a platform for sharing and discussing experiences in
real time. This rich source of information may also prove use-
ful to researchers for uncovering evolving insights into post-
acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 (PACS), commonly referred
to as Long COVID. In order to leverage social media data, we
propose using entity-extraction methods for providing clini-
cal insights prior to defining subsequent downstream tasks.
In this work, we address the gap between state-of-the-art en-
tity recognition models, and the extraction of clinically rele-
vant entities which may be useful to provide explanations for
gaining relevant insights from Twitter data. We then propose
an approach to bridge the gap by utilizing existing config-
urable tools, and datasets to enhance the capabilities of these
models.
