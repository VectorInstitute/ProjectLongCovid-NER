# LongCOVID_Insights
This repository includes a set of tools and models used in the NLP pipeline for automatic extraction and encoding of data from social media to fascilitate access and retreival of information. and Reddit are used here as independent social media sources. The NLP pipeline for automated extraction and encoding of information involves Data Collection and Preprocessing, Long Covid Filter (only for Twitter data), Entity Extraction, and Normalization components.


The Vector Institute’s Industry Innovation and AI Engineering teams worked with Roche Canada, Deloitte and TELUS to explore this question. Their project: applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to social media posts made by people with long COVID to see if any patterns arise. This involved creating a machine learning pipeline and testing the capabilities of various NLP models on first-hand testimony from social media. The hope is that these patterns, if identified, could reveal clues about when and how frequently symptoms arise and where clusters of the condition occur. Any insights could be shared with clinicians to hone their research questions, identify trends early, or inform treatment strategies.

## LongCovid Dashboard
Setup:
- `pip install requirements.txt`
for Windows: 
    - `pipwin install gdal`  
    - `pipwin install fiona`

From dashboard directory:
- `streamlit run ./main.py`

## Data creation
We provide a suite of scripts to download and create twitter and reddit data along with a list of hashtags, etc. The process consists of three steps. 

1. Navigate to `SocialMediaData_creation/`.
2. There is an example config file used to highlight how to configure your run. Setup
    your config file with the various include, excludes, hashtags, etc.
3. Run `SocialMediaData_creation/main.py` and pass the necessary `key_file`, `credential_key`,
   `config_file`, and `output_file` parameters with `-k`, `-kc`, `-c`, and `-o`
   respectively, via the command line.

A sample command using the config under ./sample
```
python main.py -k sample/api_keys.yaml -ck v2_key -c sample/config_run.ini
```
## Information Extraction Pipeline
### Entity Extraction

Our UMLSBERT model which is finetuned on the [n2c2 (2010)](https://portal.dbmi.hms.harvard.edu/projects/n2c2-nlp/) challenge for entity extraction is [available on huggingface](https://huggingface.co/RohanVB/umlsbert_ner).

### Enitity Normalization

### MetaMapLite 

MetaMapLite is used for obtaining CUI codes used to label entities, and can be installed [here](https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/ii/tools/MetaMap/run-locally/MetaMapLite.html).
